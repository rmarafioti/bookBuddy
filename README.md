Book Buddy Project:

I started this project by creating a wireframe for the ui which I then broke down to a wireframe representing state, app components, their paths and how component information is retrived or changed via the book buddy api.

After the initial set up of files and path functionality I ran into some trouble with my code. Using source code, documentation and some help from chapGPT I ended up with an app that functioned 90% but was not refetching by utilizing 'provideTags' and "invalidatesTag'. This made it so I had to refresh the page when I changed view or deleted a reservation. My intuition was that I had too much code that was not doing what it needed to do properly.

To not start over from scratch & show transparency I created a feature branch in git and worked to correct the issues. In doing so I noticed that pairing down child components I had declared in my wireframe was also helpful in keeping things more organized. I understanded pivoting from my initial outline is not be the best practice but because I am still learning and the only one working on the project I decided to do so.

Once all the changes were made I merged my branch back to main and moved forward with styling.

Overall I am happy I was able to achieve the functionality that the project asked for and create a styled look with css knowledge I've gained from styling other past projects.

Things I would add or improve upon:
